# LuSiTa
 
 In this repository it will be possible to find all the documentation regarding the LuSiTa project.
 
 In this project, our goal is to build a lamp that can change its brightness and color based on the current price of electricity. This lamp will not only be functional, but will also serve as a visual indicator of the current cost of energy consumption.

To achieve this, we will incorporate a microcontroller and an LED strip into the design of the lamp. The microcontroller will be programmed to receive and process data about the current price of electricity from a connected device, such as a computer or mobile phone. It will also control the color of the light based on the received information.
Overall, this project will provide us with valuable experience in microcontroller programming, circuit design, and product development. We look forward to creating a functional and visually appealing lamp that can help users save money and reduce their energy consumption.
